# Pneumonia_Classification_using_Pytorch

# Dataset :
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
  
  you are going to use EfficientNet model and train it on Pneumonia Chest X-Ray dataset. 
  The dataset consist of nearly 5600 Chest X-Ray images and two categories (Pneumonia/Normal). 
  Our main aim for this project is to build a pneumonia classifier which can classify Chest X-Ray scan that belong to one of the two classes. 
  You will load and fine tune the pretrained EffiecientNet model and also to create a simple pytorch trainer to train the model.
